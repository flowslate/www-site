faqs:
  - title: What is an "Active Flow"?
    answer: An Active Flow is any flow that is not paused and has a schedule (e.g., "daily," "hourly") or is run manually during the billing period. You can have as many paused or draft flows as you like; they don't count towards your limit.
  - title: What counts as a "row synced"?
    answer: We count a row every time it's successfully extracted from a source and loaded into a destination. Unlike other platforms, we don't charge for rows that are updated in place at the source. Our limits are designed to be generous enough that you'll likely never need to worry about them.
  - title: What happens if I go over my row limit on the Team plan?
    answer: We believe in predictable billing. If you have a spike in usage and go over your limit, we won't cut you off or send you a surprise bill. We'll reach out to you to discuss a plan that better fits your growing needs.
  - title: Can I change my plan at any time?
    answer: Absolutely. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time directly from your organization's billing settings.
  - title: What are "Standard Connectors"?
    answer: Our Standard Connectors on the Developer plan include our most popular database and application sources, like PostgreSQL and Google Sheets. The Team plan gives you access to our full library of connectors, including premium enterprise and cloud service connectors like AWS Cost Explorer.
